# MS-Excel_Store-Analysis_Project
HELLO
I have worked on this raw data of VRINDA STORE ANALYSIS 2022, where I have focused on the questions like:-
1. Comparing the sales and order using single chat
2. Month which got the highest sales and orders
3. Who purchased more between men and women in 2022
4. Different order status in 2022
5. Top five states contributing sales
6. Relation between age and gender based on number of order
7. Channel which is contributing to maximum sales
8. The highest selling category
INSIGHTS:-
-> Women are more likely to buy compared to men
-> Maharashtra, Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh are top 3 states
-> Adult age group (30-49 yrs) is max contributing
-> Amazon, Flipkart and Myntra channel are max contributing
CONCLUSION:-
 WE can target women customers of age group 30-49 yrs living in Maharashtra, Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh by showing ads/offers/coupons available on Amazon, Flipkart and Myntra.
